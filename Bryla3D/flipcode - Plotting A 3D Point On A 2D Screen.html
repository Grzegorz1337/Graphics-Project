The answer to this is a little more in-depth than you might think, and beyond
that, it can get quite complex (diving into homogenous 4-Dimensional
"perspective space", if you want to get specific.) However, there is a quick and
dirty answer to get you up and running in short order. I'll cover a little bit
about the background as well, to help you get accustomed to 3D.<br><br>Specifically, what you're asking about is called "perspective projection". The
concept is to project a 3D image onto a 2D screen, maintaining the look of
perspective (i.e. the foreshortening effect you get when things are farther
away, they look smaller.)<br><br>Let's consider figure 1:<br><br><center><img src="./flipcode - Plotting A 3D Point On A 2D Screen_files/askmid-06182001.gif"></center><br><br>Let's start with a few definitions. There's the viewpoint (this is where your 3D
camera is located) ï¿½ in terms of figure 1, it's at the apex where the two green
lines meet. Those green lines define your "view frustum" as seen from above. In
reality, this frustum is a four-side pyramid. Each side of the pyramid
represents the extents that the viewer can see in each of the four directions
(left, right, up, down.) The shape of the pyramid suggests that the "extents"
I'm referring to get wider and wider as the distance grows (away) from the
viewpoint.<br><br>The frustum is a pyramid for a very practical reason. Consider standing in a
field holding a picture frame out in front of you at arms length. If somebody
were to walk away from you only a few meters, they would only be able to step
side to side a few times in order to stay inside the picture frame. But if they
walk out 100 meters, they would have step sideways a lot farther in order to
step out of frame. Of course, you'll also notice that the farther away they
walk, the smaller they appear in frame.<br><br>Our goal here (as you stated) is to figure out where a point in space would be
when projected onto the screen (the picture frame.) This can be thought of as a
two-pass operation. Once for X and once for Y (the two points needed in order to
plot a point on a 2D screen.) Figure one shows the first pass: calculating X. So
figure one is a view from directly above, where the Z coordinate extends away
from the viewpoint (negative Z extends behind the viewpoint) and X extends to
the right (with negative X extending to the left.) To clarify, a point directly
in front of the viewpoint would have an X coordinate of zero, and a Z coordinate
that is the distance from the point to the viewpoint. The goal is to project the
two groups of points (which are arranged in a circular fashion in figure 1) onto
the blue line (a.k.a. the screen, a.k.a. "projection plane").<br><br>If this sounds complicated, sit tight. It should start to make sense soon.<br><br>I we were to re-state the obvious in shorter terms, we could say that the size
of an object (a set of 3D points) gets smaller as the distance to the camera
gets larger. In other words, we are performing a simple scale operation based on
the distance. Scaling translates to multiplication and division, and the
distance is the Z coordinate of the point.<br><br>So...<br><br><center><div style="width:100%; overflow:auto; background-color:#FFFFFF; border:solid 1px #c0c0c0;"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#ffffff" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="12" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="100%" bgcolor="#ffffff"><pre><font face="Courier, Courier New" color="#000000">
  x_screen = x_3D / z_3D;<br><br><font color="#007f00">// The same goes for the Y coordinate:
</font>
  y_screen = y_3D / z_3D;
 </font></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></center><br><br>But we're not done just yet. Those two coordinates (x_screen/y_screen) are
relative to the center of the screen. Remember, a person walking in the field
that hasn't stepped to one side or the other is in the center of the frame. And
2D graphics are relative to the upper-left of the screen, not the center. Also,
the typical 2D coordinate system is "X goes to the right and Y goes down." But
in 3D, X goes to the right and Y goes up. So we need to negate the Y coordinate,
or everything will be upside down. This translates to:<br><br><center><div style="width:100%; overflow:auto; background-color:#FFFFFF; border:solid 1px #c0c0c0;"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#ffffff" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="12" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="100%" bgcolor="#ffffff"><pre><font face="Courier, Courier New" color="#000000">
  half_screen_width = screen_width / 2;
  half_screen_height = screen_height / 2;<br><br>  x_screen = +(x_3D / z_3D) + half_screen_width;
  y_screen = -(y_3D / z_3D) + half_screen_height;
 </font></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></center><br><br>Since we're talking about relativity, it's important to know something else:
This calculation only works when your 3D points are relative to your 3D
viewpoint. This is always the case if your viewpoint is located at [0,0,0]. But
if not, you'll need to do some subtraction. Simply subtract each of the points'
coordinates from the viewpoint's coordinates, like so:<br><br><center><div style="width:100%; overflow:auto; background-color:#FFFFFF; border:solid 1px #c0c0c0;"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#ffffff" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="12" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="100%" bgcolor="#ffffff"><pre><font face="Courier, Courier New" color="#000000">
  x_3D = input_x ï¿½ viewpoint_x;
  y_3D = input_y ï¿½ viewpoint_y;
  z_3D = input_z ï¿½ viewpoint_z;
 </font></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></center><br><br>We've got a couple things left: First is perspective scale. Consider a point
that has a Z value of 100 (in front of the viewpoint) and an X value of 100 (to
the right of the viewpoint.) According to figure 1, which shows a 90-degree
frustum ï¿½ 45-degrees to either side, that point should be someplace on the
right-hand side green line. And if it's on the green line, the point should
project to one of the points on the far right edge of the screen. But if we
divide 100 by 100, we get 1.0. If you add the screen-center to that point,
you'll end up with a point very close to the center of the screen. So we need to
scale one more time, by half of the width &amp; height of the screen.<br><br><center><div style="width:100%; overflow:auto; background-color:#FFFFFF; border:solid 1px #c0c0c0;"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#ffffff" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="12" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="100%" bgcolor="#ffffff"><pre><font face="Courier, Courier New" color="#000000">
  half_screen_width = screen_width / 2;
  half_screen_height = screen_height / 2;<br><br>  x_screen = (+(x_3D / z_3D) + half_screen_width) * half_screen_width;
  y_screen = (-(y_3D / z_3D) + half_screen_height) * half_screen_height;
 </font></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></center><br><br>While I'm at it, I'm going to cover aspect as well. Aspect is a term that ratio
of how wide the screen is, as compared to its height. With a perfectly square
monitor (width = height) and a square video resolution (512x512) the aspect
ratio will be 1:1. Life is rarely that simple, and graphics never is. Monitors
are typically 1.3:1 (i.e. the width of your monitor is 1.3 times wider than the
height ï¿½ measure it and see for yourself. :) Fortunately, the standard video
resolutions have a matching aspect. To validate this, calculate any of these: 
320/240 or 640/480 or 800/600 or 1024/768 or 1600x1200 or 2048x1536. Due to
these aspect ratios being the same (the monitor and the video mode) they cancel
each other out.<br><br>However, you're most likely going to be rendering your graphics to a window. And
if you allow your window to be resized, the user can choose any size they want.
For a window to maintain the same convenient aspect ratio as the screen
resolution (provided you're using one of the standard resolutions with a 1.3:1
ratio), your window must also have a width:height ratio that is 1.3:1. If not,
the solution is quite simple. You need to apply one final scale to your screen
coordinates. Here's a typical aspect ratio calculation:<br><br><center><div style="width:100%; overflow:auto; background-color:#FFFFFF; border:solid 1px #c0c0c0;"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#ffffff" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="12" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="100%" bgcolor="#ffffff"><pre><font face="Courier, Courier New" color="#000000">
  window_aspect = window_width / window_height;<br><br>  <font color="#0000ff">if</font> (window_aspect &gt; 1.0)
  {
    x_screen = x_screen / window_aspect;
  }
  <font color="#0000ff">else</font>
  {
    y_screen = y_screen * window_aspect;
  }
 </font></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></center><br><br>If you're simply trying to get some 3D displayed in your application (for
graphs, etc.) then this explanation should suffice. However, if you plan on
diving into 3D seriously, you should study up on 3D transformations. As I stated
earlier, this can get rather complex but in the end it simplifies things
tremendously, while giving you a lot more control over the display of your 3D
world. This is important, because the transformation pipeline can combine a
series of different operations in a single transform. As your tasks get more
complex, it will be harder to keep track of what's going on (and difficult to
keep efficient.)
